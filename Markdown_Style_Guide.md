# ðŸ§¾ Markdown Documentation Style Guide

This guide outlines conventions for maintaining clean, consistent, and professional Markdown documentation across all repositories.

---

## 1. Typography Conventions

- Use **sentence case** for headings and titles.
- Always prefer **active voice** and concise phrasing.
- Avoid contractions (e.g., use "do not" instead of "don't").
- Use single spaces after punctuation, not double.
- Write in **second person** for instructions ("you should", "use this", etc.).

## 2. Document Structure

- Start every document with a `# Title` followed by a brief 1â€“2 line description.
- Use horizontal rules (`---`) to clearly separate major sections.
- Follow a consistent heading hierarchy:
  - `#` for Document Title (once)
  - `##` for Primary Sections
  - `###` for Subsections
  - `####` for Detailed Items or Edge Cases

---

## 3. Formatting Best Practices

- Use bullet points (`-`) for unordered lists; avoid asterisks (`*`).
- Use numbered lists (`1.`) only where order matters.
- Use backticks (`` ` ``) for inline code and triple backticks (\`\`\`) for code blocks.
- Do not use raw HTML unless absolutely necessary.
- Indent code blocks and lists correctly to preserve structure.
- Avoid excessive bolding or italicization; use sparingly for emphasis.
- Always place a blank line before and after lists, code blocks, and headings.
