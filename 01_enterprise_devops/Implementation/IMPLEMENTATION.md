## üîß PART 1 - Pre-Implementation Summary 
This section documents all completed steps prior to introducing branching strategies and formal multi-stage DevOps deployment pipelines.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Initialization

- Built the **DevOps Glossary App** using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON.
- Structured the source code under the `/project_repo/` directory.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Version Control Setup

- Initialized a Git repository for version tracking.
- Pushed the project to GitHub.
- Followed best practices for repository structure and commit hygiene.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-Environment Deployment (Initial)

| Environment | Platform       | Deployment Target | Status |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| Development | GitHub Pages   | `/project_repo/`  | ‚úÖ Live |
| Testing / Early Production | Vercel         | `/project_repo/`  | ‚úÖ Live |

- **GitHub Pages**: Used for active development previews.
- **Vercel**: Configured as a fast, CDN-backed deployment for testing and early production.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ CI/CD Integration via GitHub Actions

- Implemented `ci.yml` GitHub Actions workflow:
  - HTML validation via **HTMLHint**
  - JavaScript syntax checking via **Node**
- Workflow triggered on all pushes and pull requests to the `main` branch.
- CI status visible via the **GitHub Actions dashboard**.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Project Reporting and Documentation

- Generated a full Word-based project report with:
  - Implementation screenshots
  - CI logs
  - Deployment overview
- Documented all setup activities in Markdown for in-repo DevOps traceability.

---

This baseline setup provides a strong foundation for next-phase DevOps implementations, including:
- Git-based branching models
- Pull request enforcement
- Azure production deployment pipelines

## üîÅ PART 2 - Steps to Implement Branching Strategy for Multi-Environment DevOps

This section defines the step-by-step transformation from a single-branch deployment model to a full enterprise-grade branching and environment strategy, in alignment with AZ-400 practices.

---

### üìå Current State

- Both **GitHub Pages** and **Vercel** are deploying directly from the `main` branch.
- No branching or gating is in place for development, testing, or production stages.

---

### üîÑ Step-by-Step Transformation Plan

#### ‚úÖ Step 1: Define and Create Environment Branches

| Branch    | Purpose                       | Deployment Target |
|-----------|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| `dev`     | Active development & testing  | GitHub Pages       |
| `main`    | Staging/QA approved builds    | Vercel             |
| `release` | Production-ready releases     | Azure (TBD)        |

```bash
git checkout -b dev
git checkout -b release
git push origin dev
git push origin release
```

---

#### üõ† Step 2: Reconfigure Deployment Targets

- **GitHub Pages** ‚Üí Change to deploy from `dev` branch
- **Vercel** ‚Üí Remains tied to `main` branch (Preview + Production)
- **Azure** ‚Üí Will deploy from `release` branch (to be implemented)

---

#### üîê Step 3: Protect Critical Branches

- Enable **branch protection** for:
  - `main` ‚Üí Require PRs, CI passing, code review
  - `release` ‚Üí Merge only via approved PRs or tagged releases
- Disallow direct commits to `main` and `release`

---

#### üîÑ Step 4: Update GitHub Actions

- Modify your `ci.yml` to run on `dev`, `main`, and `release` branches
- Add branching logic or separate workflows if needed

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [dev, main, release]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, release]
```

---

#### üåê Step 5: Configure Azure Production (Future Phase)

- [ ] Setup Azure Static Web App or App Service
- [ ] Store Azure credentials in GitHub Secrets
- [ ] Deploy only from `release` branch
- [ ] Create `azure-prod.yml` GitHub Actions workflow for release deployment

---

### ‚úÖ Outcome: Aligned Three-Tier DevOps Flow

| Environment      | Branch    | Platform       | Status        |
|------------------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Development      | `dev`     | GitHub Pages   | ‚úÖ Configured |
| Testing/Staging  | `main`    | Vercel         | ‚úÖ Configured |
| Production       | `release` | Azure (TBD)    | ‚è≥ Upcoming   |

---

This branching model will help implement a gated, testable, and scalable CI/CD pipeline aligned with real-world enterprise DevOps workflows.
